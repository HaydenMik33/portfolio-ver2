                &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I grew up in south Korea, came to America after I graduated my high school. I felt
                really lost on the first year in the U.S because I was not sure that I could study my major, genetic
                engineering in English and paying the world most expersive tuition for four years. So I started looking
                for something that I was interested in but never done in my life. While I was going through that
                process, I heard about virture reality and I first got exposed to programming. I learned C# to use
                unity, since I didn't have any knowdlege in this field I learned .NET framwork along with it. I wanted
                to learn more deeper about it so I went to immersive web development courses covered Javascript mainly.
                Graduating that course,I've worked for a couple local business.I've been keep learning and coding
                everyday,felt this is what I really want to do for rest of my life. The fact that there's no end of
                learning in this field always keep me excited and motivated.
